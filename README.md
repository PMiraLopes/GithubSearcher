# React GigthubSearcher

Hello I'm Pedro, this is my implementation of a github user and repositores searcher page implemented using React JS.

Regarding the implementation, to run it you just need to do the following steps

1. npm install to install some dependencies of the project 
2. npm start to run create a local server to the page
3. Go to http://localhost:8080 and test the page ;)

If you have any doubts please feel free to let me know or make a code review with me.

Best regards,

Pedro Mira Lopes
